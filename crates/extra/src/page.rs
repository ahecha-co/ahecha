// TODO: Experiment again with pages, but this time also with getServerSideProps and getStaticProps, and automatically generate the page route.
// Maybe infer the route if the route attribute is missing?
// Open question, how to register the route? Make it a macro? Auto generate code with [tests](https://matklad.github.io/2022/03/26/self-modifying-code.html)?
